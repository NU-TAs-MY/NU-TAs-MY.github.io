## Mathematics

## Important Definitions in Machine Learning

- What is Artificial intelligence?
  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans.
- What is Machine Learning?
  - Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.
- What is Big data?
  - big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources.
- What is Data Science?
  -  preparing data for analysis, including cleaning, aggregating, and manipulating the data to perform advanced data analysis. After data analytics we could predict or draw insights from data.
