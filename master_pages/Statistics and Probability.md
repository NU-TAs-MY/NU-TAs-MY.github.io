## Statistics Introduction

- what is statistics?
  - Statistics is the field of science that deals with the collection analysis, interpretation, and use of data to make decisions and draw conclusions.
- Statistics Objectives / Types
  - *Descriptive Statistics* Describe and Summarize data
  - *Relational Statistics* Relationship between two or more variables. (correlation, causality, etc.)
  - *Inferential Statistics* Generalization from samples to populations and hypthesis testing.
- What are Data
  - *Quantitative* numerical or binary (audio files or images)
    - could be discrete or continuous
  - *Qualitative* categorical


## Data Descriptors (Descriptive Statistics)

- The most common descriptive statistics:
  - *central tendency measures* called **averages**
    - Mean: the arithmetic mean. Also there is a weighted mean
    - Mode: the most frequent value in a data set
    - Median: the middle index of sorted values. could be unimodela, bimodal, trimodal, etc.
  - *dispersion measures*
    - Range: the difference between minimum and maximum
    - Standard deviation or variance: the average (mean) of the squared deviation of each value in a data set, of n elements, from the data set mean
    - Median absolute Difference (MAD): the median of the difference between data set and their true median.
