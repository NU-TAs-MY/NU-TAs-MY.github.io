## Description
Basic laws underlying performance evaluation. The student learns how to design the control and data path hardware for a processor, how to make machine instructions execute simultaneously through pipelining and simple superscalar execution, and how to design fast memory and storage systems. Students also learn assembly language programming. The principles presented in lecture are reinforced in the laboratory through design and simulation of a register transfer (RT) implementations in Verilog.
