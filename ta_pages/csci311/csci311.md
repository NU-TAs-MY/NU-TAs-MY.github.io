## Description
Basic laws underlying performance evaluation. The student learns how to design the control and data path hardware for a processor, how to make machine instructions execute simultaneously through pipelining and simple superscalar execution, and how to design fast memory and storage systems. Students also learn assembly language programming. The principles presented in lecture are reinforced in the laboratory through design and simulation of a register transfer (RT) implementations in Verilog.

## Course Objectives
- Understand how a computing platform (processor + memory + interconnect) works
- Implement a simple platform (with not so simple parts), with a focus on the processor and memory
- Understand how decisions made in hardware affect the software/programmer as well as hardware designer
- Think critically (in solving problems)
- Think broadly across the levels of transformation
- Understand how to analyze and make tradeoffs in design
